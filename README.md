Diet-NG
=======

Diet is a generic compile-time template system based on an XML-like structure. The syntax is heavily influenced by [Jade](jade-lang.com) and outputting dynamic HTML is the primary goal. It supports pluggable transformation modules, as well as output modules, so that many other uses are possible.

This repository contians the designated successor implementation of the [`vibe.templ.diet` module](https://vibed.org/api/vibe.templ.diet/) of [vibe.d](https://vibed.org/). It's currently in an early development state and shouldn't be used for production yet.
